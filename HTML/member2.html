        <h1>Shiela Anne C. Oriola</h1>
        <p>19 years old</p>
        <p>I am a second year IT student from PUP Sta. Rosa, Laguna. I find this course very interesting, and helpful even in my daily life. As the stereotype goes, yes, I am an introvert and I like doing things in my own space and time. Aside from the computer and techy stuff, I also have a variety of hobbies that I do everyday. I have had a passion for drawing since I was a child and I've always wanted to be an architect. Another hobby of mine is dancing, it started when I was in highschool obsessing over kpop and only dancing inside my room, and now I've stepped out of my comfort zone and joined our IT Dance Squad to further improve my skills and make new friends. These two are main hobbies. Sometimes when I don't have the inspiration to do them, I do other things such as video games, baking, trying to play  piano and kalimba and occasionally playing badminton with my friends and family. I am a very optimistic person and always try my best to see the bright side of things rather than being negative about it. And to me, exploring and seeing the beauty of life itself makes me really happy and I always look forward to see what another day has in store for me.</p>
